Returns the SDL comaptible GUID of the specified joystick\&. This function returns the SDL compatible GUID, as a UTF-8 encoded hexadecimal string, of the specified joystick\&. The returned string is allocated and freed by GLFW\&. You should not free it yourself\&.

The GUID is what connects a joystick to a gamepad mapping\&. A connected joystick will always have a GUID even if there is no gamepad mapping assigned to it\&.

The GUID uses the format introduced in SDL 2\&.0\&.5\&.
