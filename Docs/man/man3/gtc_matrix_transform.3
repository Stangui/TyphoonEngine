.SH SYNOPSIS

.PP
.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Include <\fBglm/gtc/matrix_transform\&.hpp\fP> to use the features of this extension\&.
.PP
Defines functions that generate common transformation matrices\&.
.PP
The matrices generated by this extension use standard OpenGL fixed-function conventions\&. For example, the lookAt function generates a transform from world space into the specific eye space that the projective matrix functions (perspective, ortho, etc) are designed to expect\&. The OpenGL compatibility specifications defines the particular layout of this eye space\&. 
.SH "Author"
