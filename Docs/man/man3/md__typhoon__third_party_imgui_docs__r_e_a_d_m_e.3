Dear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++\&. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline enabled application\&. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic and self-contained (no external dependencies)\&.
.PP
Dear ImGui is designed to enable fast iterations and to empower programmers to create content creation tools and visualization / debug tools (as opposed to UI for the average end-user)\&. It favors simplicity and productivity toward this goal, and lacks certain features normally found in more high-level libraries\&.
.PP
Dear ImGui is particularly suited to integration in games engine (for tooling), real-time 3D applications, fullscreen applications, embedded applications, or any applications on consoles platforms where operating system features are non-standard\&.
.PP
See \fCSoftware using dear imgui\fP, \fCQuotes\fP and \fCGallery\fP pages to get an idea of its use cases\&.
.PP
Dear ImGui is self-contained within a few files that you can easily copy and compile into your application/engine:
.IP "\(bu" 2
imgui\&.cpp
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBimgui\&.h\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
imgui_demo\&.cpp
.IP "\(bu" 2

\fBimstb_rectpack\&.h\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBimstb_textedit\&.h\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBimstb_truetype\&.h\fP
.PP
.PP
No specific build process is required\&. You can add the \&.cpp files to your project or #include them from an existing file\&.
.PP
.SS "Usage"
.PP
Your code passes mouse/keyboard/gamepad inputs and settings to Dear ImGui (see example applications for more details)\&. After Dear ImGui is setup, you can use it from _anywhere_ in your program loop:
.PP
Code: 
.PP
.nf
ImGui::Text("Hello, world %d", 123);
if (ImGui::Button("Save"))
{
    // do stuff
}
ImGui::InputText("string", buf, IM_ARRAYSIZE(buf));
ImGui::SliderFloat("float", &f, 0\&.0f, 1\&.0f);

.fi
.PP
 Result: 
.br
 
.br
_(settings: Dark style (left), Light style (right) / Font: Roboto-Medium, 16px / Rounding: 5)_
.PP
Code: 
.PP
.nf
// Create a window called "My First Tool", with a menu bar\&.
ImGui::Begin("My First Tool", &my_tool_active, ImGuiWindowFlags_MenuBar);
if (ImGui::BeginMenuBar())
{
    if (ImGui::BeginMenu("File"))
    {
        if (ImGui::MenuItem("Open\&.\&.", "Ctrl+O")) { /* Do stuff */ }
        if (ImGui::MenuItem("Save", "Ctrl+S"))   { /* Do stuff */ }
        if (ImGui::MenuItem("Close", "Ctrl+W"))  { my_tool_active = false; }
        ImGui::EndMenu();
    }
    ImGui::EndMenuBar();
}

// Edit a color (stored as ~4 floats)
ImGui::ColorEdit4("Color", my_color);

// Plot some values
const float my_values[] = { 0\&.2f, 0\&.1f, 1\&.0f, 0\&.5f, 0\&.9f, 2\&.2f };
ImGui::PlotLines("Frame Times", my_values, IM_ARRAYSIZE(my_values));

// Display contents in a scrolling region
ImGui::TextColored(ImVec4(1,1,0,1), "Important Stuff");
ImGui::BeginChild("Scrolling");
for (int n = 0; n < 50; n++)
    ImGui::Text("%04d: Some text", n);
ImGui::EndChild();
ImGui::End();

.SS "How it works"
.PP
Check out the References section if you want to understand the core principles behind the IMGUI paradigm\&. An IMGUI tries to minimize superfluous state duplication, state synchronization and state retention from the user's point of view\&. It is less error prone (less code and less bugs) than traditional retained-mode interfaces, and lends itself to create dynamic user interfaces\&.
.PP
Dear ImGui outputs vertex buffers and command lists that you can easily render in your application\&. The number of draw calls and state changes required to render them is fairly small\&. Because Dear ImGui doesn't know or touch graphics state directly, you can call its functions anywhere in your code (e\&.g\&. in the middle of a running algorithm, or in the middle of your own rendering process)\&. Refer to the sample applications in the examples/ folder for instructions on how to integrate dear imgui with your existing codebase\&.
.PP
\fIA common misunderstanding is to mistake immediate mode gui for immediate mode rendering, which usually implies hammering your driver/GPU with a bunch of inefficient draw calls and state changes as the gui functions are called\&. This is NOT what Dear ImGui does\&. Dear ImGui outputs vertex buffers and a small list of draw calls batches\&. It never touches your GPU directly\&. The draw call batches are decently optimal and you can render them later, in your app or even remotely\&.\fP
.PP
Dear ImGui allows you create elaborate tools as well as very short-lived ones\&. On the extreme side of short-liveness: using the Edit&Continue (hot code reload) feature of modern compilers you can add a few widgets to tweaks variables while your application is running, and remove the code a minute later! Dear ImGui is not just for tweaking values\&. You can use it to trace a running algorithm by just emitting text commands\&. You can use it along with your own reflection data to browse your dataset live\&. You can use it to expose the internals of a subsystem in your engine, to create a logger, an inspection tool, a profiler, a debugger, an entire game making editor/framework, etc\&.
.PP
.SS "Demo Binaries "
.PP
You should be able to build the examples from sources (tested on Windows/Mac/Linux)\&. If you don't, let me know! If you want to have a quick look at some Dear ImGui features, you can download Windows binaries of the demo app here:
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCimgui-demo-binaries-20190219\&.zip\fP (Windows binaries, Dear ImGui 1\&.68 built 2019/02/19, master branch, 5 executables)
.PP
.PP
The demo applications are unfortunately not yet DPI aware so expect some blurriness on a 4K screen\&. For DPI awareness in your application, you can load/reload your font at different scale, and scale your Style with \fCstyle\&.ScaleAllSizes()\fP\&.
.PP
.SS "Bindings "
.PP
Integrating Dear ImGui within your custom engine is a matter of 1) wiring mouse/keyboard/gamepad inputs 2) uploading one texture to your GPU/render engine 3) providing a render function that can bind textures and render textured triangles\&. The \fCexamples/\fP folder is populated with applications doing just that\&. If you are an experienced programmer at ease with those concepts, it should take you about an hour to integrate Dear ImGui in your custom engine\&. Make sure to spend time reading the FAQ, the comments and other documentation!
.PP
\fINB: those third-party bindings may be more or less maintained, more or less close to the original API (as people who create language bindings sometimes haven't used the C++ API themselves\&.\&. for the good reason that they aren't C++ users)\&. Dear ImGui was designed with C++ in mind and some of the subtleties may be lost in translation with other languages\&. If your language supports it, I would suggest replicating the function overloading and default parameters used in the original, else the API may be harder to use\&. In doubt, please check the original C++ version first!\fP

Dozens of standalone example applications using e\&.g\&. OpenGL/DirectX are provided in the examples/ folder to explain how to integrate Dear ImGui with your own engine/application\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Your programming IDE is your friend, find the type or function declaration to find comments associated to it\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
We obviously needs better documentation! Consider contributing or becoming a \fCPatron\fP to promote this effort\&.
.PP
.PP
\fBWhich version should I get?\fP
.PP
I occasionally tag \fCReleases\fP but it is generally safe and recommended to sync to master/latest\&. The library is fairly stable and regressions tend to be fixed fast when reported\&.
.PP
You may also peak at the \fCMulti-Viewport\fP and \fCDocking\fP features in the \fCdocking\fP branch\&. Many projects are using this branch and it is kept in sync with master regularly\&.
.PP
\fBWho uses Dear ImGui?\fP
.PP
See the \fCQuotes\fP and \fCSoftware using dear imgui\fP Wiki pages for a list of games/software which are publicly known to use dear imgui\&. Please add yours if you can!
.PP
\fBWhy the odd dual naming, 'Dear ImGui' vs 'ImGui'?\fP
.PP
The library started its life as 'ImGui' due to the fact that I didn't give it a proper name when I released 1\&.0 and had no particular expectation that it would take off\&. However, the term IMGUI (immediate-mode graphical user interface) was coined before and is being used in variety of other situations (e\&.g\&. Unity uses it own implementation of the IMGUI paradigm)\&. To reduce this ambiguity without affecting existing codebases, I have decided on an alternate, longer name 'Dear ImGui' that people can use to refer to this specific library\&. Please try to refer to this library as 'Dear ImGui'\&.
.PP
\fBHow can I tell whether to dispatch mouse/keyboard to Dear ImGui or to my application?\fP 
.br
**How can I display an image? What is ImTextureID, how does it works?** 
.br
**Why are multiple widgets reacting when I interact with a single one? How can I have multiple widgets with the same label or with an empty label? A primer on labels and the ID Stack\&.\&.\&.** 
.br
**How can I use my own math types instead of ImVec2/ImVec4?** 
.br
**How can I load a different font than the default?** 
.br
**How can I easily use icons in my application?** 
.br
**How can I load multiple fonts?** 
.br
**How can I display and input non-latin characters such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Cyrillic?** (\fCexample\fP) 
.br
**How can I interact with standard C++ types (such as std::string and std::vector)?** 
.br
**How can I use the drawing facilities without a Dear ImGui window? (using \fBImDrawList\fP API)** 
.br
**How can I use this without a mouse, without a keyboard or without a screen? (gamepad, input share, remote display)** 
.br
**I integrated Dear ImGui in my engine and the text or lines are blurry\&.\&.** 
.br
**I integrated Dear ImGui in my engine and some elements are disappearing when I move windows around\&.\&.** 
.br
**How can I help?**
.PP
See the FAQ in \fCimgui\&.cpp\fP for answers\&.
.PP
\fBCan you create elaborate/serious tools with Dear ImGui?\fP
.PP
Yes\&. People have written game editors, data browsers, debuggers, profilers and all sort of non-trivial tools with the library\&. In my experience the simplicity of the API is very empowering\&. Your UI runs close to your live data\&. Make the tools always-on and everybody in the team will be inclined to create new tools (as opposed to more 'offline' UI toolkits where only a fraction of your team effectively creates tools)\&. The list of sponsors below is also an indicator that serious game teams have been using the library\&.
.PP
Dear ImGui is very programmer centric and the immediate-mode GUI paradigm might requires you to readjust some habits before you can realize its full potential\&. Dear ImGui is about making things that are simple, efficient and powerful\&.
.PP
\fBCan you reskin the look of Dear ImGui?\fP
.PP
You can alter the look of the interface to some degree: changing colors, sizes, padding, rounding, fonts\&. However, as Dear ImGui is designed and optimized to create debug tools, the amount of skinning you can apply is limited\&. There is only so much you can stray away from the default look and feel of the interface\&. Below is a screenshot from \fCLumixEngine\fP with custom colors + a docking/tabs extension (both of which you can find in the Issues section and will eventually be merged):
.PP
.PP
\fBWhy using C++ (as opposed to C)?\fP
.PP
Dear ImGui takes advantage of a few C++ languages features for convenience but nothing anywhere Boost-insanity/quagmire\&. Dear ImGui does NOT require C++11 so it can be used with most old C++ compilers\&. Dear ImGui doesn't use any C++ header file\&. Language-wise, function overloading and default parameters are used to make the API easier to use and code more terse\&. Doing so I believe the API is sitting on a sweet spot and giving up on those features would make the API more cumbersome\&. Other features such as namespace, constructors and templates (in the case of the ImVector<> class) are also relied on as a convenience\&.
.PP
There is an auto-generated \fCc-api for Dear ImGui (cimgui)\fP by Sonoro1234 and Stephan Dilly\&. It is designed for creating binding to other languages\&. If possible, I would suggest using your target language functionalities to try replicating the function overloading and default parameters used in C++ else the API may be harder to use\&. Also see \fCBindings\fP for various third-party bindings\&.

Developed by \fCOmar Cornut\fP and every direct or indirect contributors to the GitHub\&. The early version of this library was developed with the support of \fCMedia Molecule\fP and first used internally on the game \fCTearaway\fP\&.
.PP
I first discovered the IMGUI paradigm at \fCQ-Games\fP where Atman Binstock had dropped his own simple implementation in the codebase, which I spent quite some time improving and thinking about\&. It turned out that Atman was exposed to the concept directly by working with Casey\&. When I moved to Media Molecule I rewrote a new library trying to overcome the flaws and limitations of the first one I've worked with\&. It became this library and since then I have spent an unreasonable amount of time iterating and improving it\&.
