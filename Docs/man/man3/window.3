To query the actual attributes of the created window, framebuffer and context, see \fBglfwGetWindowAttrib\fP, \fBglfwGetWindowSize\fP and \fBglfwGetFramebufferSize\fP\&.
.PP
To create a full screen window, you need to specify the monitor the window will cover\&. If no monitor is specified, the window will be windowed mode\&. Unless you have a way for the user to choose a specific monitor, it is recommended that you pick the primary monitor\&. For more information on how to query connected monitors, see \fBRetrieving monitors\fP\&.
.PP
For full screen windows, the specified size becomes the resolution of the window's \fIdesired video mode\fP\&. As long as a full screen window is not iconified, the supported video mode most closely matching the desired video mode is set for the specified monitor\&. For more information about full screen windows, including the creation of so called \fIwindowed full screen\fP or \fIborderless full screen\fP windows, see \fB'Windowed full screen' windows\fP\&.
.PP
Once you have created the window, you can switch it between windowed and full screen mode with \fBglfwSetWindowMonitor\fP\&. This will not affect its OpenGL or OpenGL ES context\&.
.PP
By default, newly created windows use the placement recommended by the window system\&. To create the window at a specific position, make it initially invisible using the \fBGLFW_VISIBLE\fP window hint, set its \fBposition\fP and then \fBshow\fP it\&.

@macos The first time a window is created the menu bar is created\&. If GLFW finds a \fCMainMenu\&.nib\fP it is loaded and assumed to contain a menu bar\&. Otherwise a minimal menu bar is created manually with common commands like Hide, Quit and About\&. The About entry opens a minimal about dialog with information from the application's bundle\&.

@x11 Some window managers will not respect the placement of initially hidden windows\&.

@x11 Due to the asynchronous nature of X11, it may take a moment for a window to reach its requested state\&. This means you may not be able to query the final size, position or other attributes directly after window creation\&.

@x11 The class part of the \fCWM_CLASS\fP window property will by default be set to the window title passed to this function\&. The instance part will use the contents of the \fCRESOURCE_NAME\fP environment variable, if present and not empty, or fall back to the window title\&. Set the \fBGLFW_X11_CLASS_NAME\fP and \fBGLFW_X11_INSTANCE_NAME\fP window hints to override this\&.

@wayland Compositors should implement the xdg-decoration protocol for GLFW to decorate the window properly\&.

.SS "GLFWAPI void glfwPollEvents (void)"

Processes all pending events\&. This function processes only those events that are already in the event queue and then returns immediately\&. Processing events will cause the window and input callbacks associated with those events to be called\&.

Do not assume that callbacks you set will \fIonly\fP be called in response to event processing functions like this one\&.
