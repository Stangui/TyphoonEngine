.PP
Returns the Vulkan instance extensions required by GLFW\&. This function returns an array of names of Vulkan instance extensions required by GLFW for creating Vulkan surfaces for GLFW windows\&. If successful, the list will always contain \fCVK_KHR_surface\fP, so if you don't require any additional extensions you can pass this list directly to the \fC\fBVkInstanceCreateInfo\fP\fP struct\&.
.PP
If Vulkan is not available on the machine, this function returns \fCNULL\fP and generates a \fBGLFW_API_UNAVAILABLE\fP error\&. Call \fBglfwVulkanSupported\fP to check whether Vulkan is at least minimally available\&.
.PP
If Vulkan is available but no set of extensions allowing window surface creation was found, this function returns \fCNULL\fP\&. You may still use Vulkan for off-screen rendering and compute work\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIcount\fP Where to store the number of extensions in the returned array\&. This is set to zero if an error occurred\&. 
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
An array of ASCII encoded extension names, or \fCNULL\fP if an \fBerror\fP occurred\&.
.RE
.PP
@errors Possible errors include \fBGLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED\fP and \fBGLFW_API_UNAVAILABLE\fP\&.
.PP
\fBRemarks:\fP
.RS 4
Additional extensions may be required by future versions of GLFW\&. You should check if any extensions you wish to enable are already in the returned array, as it is an error to specify an extension more than once in the \fC\fBVkInstanceCreateInfo\fP\fP struct\&.
.PP
@macos This function currently only supports the \fCVK_MVK_macos_surface\fP extension from MoltenVK\&.
.RE
.PP
@pointer_lifetime The returned array is allocated and freed by GLFW\&. You should not free it yourself\&. It is guaranteed to be valid only until the library is terminated\&.
.PP
@thread_safety This function may be called from any thread\&.

.SS "GLFWAPI int glfwVulkanSupported (void)"

.PP
Returns whether the Vulkan loader and an ICD have been found\&. Returns whether the Vulkan loader has been found\&.
.PP
This function returns whether the Vulkan loader and any minimally functional ICD have been found\&.
.PP
The availability of a Vulkan loader and even an ICD does not by itself guarantee that surface creation or even instance creation is possible\&. For example, on Fermi systems Nvidia will install an ICD that provides no actual Vulkan support\&. Call \fBglfwGetRequiredInstanceExtensions\fP to check whether the extensions necessary for Vulkan surface creation are available and \fBglfwGetPhysicalDevicePresentationSupport\fP to check whether a queue family of a physical device supports image presentation\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
\fCGLFW_TRUE\fP if Vulkan is minimally available, or \fCGLFW_FALSE\fP otherwise\&.
