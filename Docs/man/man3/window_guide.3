.SH "Window objects"
.PP
The \fBGLFWwindow\fP object encapsulates both a window and a context\&. They are created with \fBglfwCreateWindow\fP and destroyed with \fBglfwDestroyWindow\fP, or \fBglfwTerminate\fP, if any remain\&. As the window and context are inseparably linked, the object pointer is used as both a context and window handle\&.
.PP
To see the event stream provided to the various window related callbacks, run the \fCevents\fP test program\&.
.SS "Window creation"
A window and its OpenGL or OpenGL ES context are created with \fBglfwCreateWindow\fP, which returns a handle to the created window object\&. For example, this creates a 640 by 480 windowed mode window:
.PP
.PP
.nf
GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(640, 480, "My Title", NULL, NULL);
.fi
.PP
.PP
If window creation fails, \fCNULL\fP will be returned, so it is necessary to check the return value\&.
.PP
The window handle is passed to all window related functions and is provided to along with all input events, so event handlers can tell which window received the event\&.
.SS "Full screen windows"
To create a full screen window, you need to specify which monitor the window should use\&. In most cases, the user's primary monitor is a good choice\&. For more information about retrieving monitors, see \fBRetrieving monitors\fP\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(640, 480, "My Title", glfwGetPrimaryMonitor(), NULL);
.fi
.PP
.PP
Full screen windows cover the entire display area of a monitor, have no border or decorations\&.
.PP
Windowed mode windows can be made full screen by setting a monitor with \fBglfwSetWindowMonitor\fP, and full screen ones can be made windowed by unsetting it with the same function\&.
.PP
Each field of the \fBGLFWvidmode\fP structure corresponds to a function parameter or window hint and combine to form the \fIdesired video mode\fP for that window\&. The supported video mode most closely matching the desired video mode will be set for the chosen monitor as long as the window has input focus\&. For more information about retrieving video modes, see \fBVideo modes\fP\&.
.PP
Video mode field  Corresponds to   \fBGLFWvidmode\&.width\fP  \fCwidth\fP parameter of \fBglfwCreateWindow\fP   \fBGLFWvidmode\&.height\fP  \fCheight\fP parameter of \fBglfwCreateWindow\fP   \fBGLFWvidmode\&.redBits\fP  \fBGLFW_RED_BITS\fP hint   \fBGLFWvidmode\&.greenBits\fP  \fBGLFW_GREEN_BITS\fP hint   \fBGLFWvidmode\&.blueBits\fP  \fBGLFW_BLUE_BITS\fP hint   \fBGLFWvidmode\&.refreshRate\fP  \fBGLFW_REFRESH_RATE\fP hint   
.PP
Once you have a full screen window, you can change its resolution, refresh rate and monitor with \fBglfwSetWindowMonitor\fP\&. If you only need change its resolution you can also call \fBglfwSetWindowSize\fP\&. In all cases, the new video mode will be selected the same way as the video mode chosen by \fBglfwCreateWindow\fP\&. If the window has an OpenGL or OpenGL ES context, it will be unaffected\&.
.PP
By default, the original video mode of the monitor will be restored and the window iconified if it loses input focus, to allow the user to switch back to the desktop\&. This behavior can be disabled with the \fBGLFW_AUTO_ICONIFY\fP window hint, for example if you wish to simultaneously cover multiple monitors with full screen windows\&.
.PP
If a monitor is disconnected, all windows that are full screen on that monitor will be switched to windowed mode\&. See \fBMonitor configuration changes\fP for more information\&.
.SS "'Windowed full screen' windows"
If the closest match for the desired video mode is the current one, the video mode will not be changed, making window creation faster and application switching much smoother\&. This is sometimes called \fIwindowed full screen\fP or \fIborderless full screen\fP window and counts as a full screen window\&. To create such a window, request the current video mode\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
const GLFWvidmode* mode = glfwGetVideoMode(monitor);

glfwWindowHint(GLFW_RED_BITS, mode->redBits);
glfwWindowHint(GLFW_GREEN_BITS, mode->greenBits);
glfwWindowHint(GLFW_BLUE_BITS, mode->blueBits);
glfwWindowHint(GLFW_REFRESH_RATE, mode->refreshRate);

GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(mode->width, mode->height, "My Title", monitor, NULL);
.fi
.PP
.PP
This also works for windowed mode windows that are made full screen\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
const GLFWvidmode* mode = glfwGetVideoMode(monitor);

glfwSetWindowMonitor(window, monitor, 0, 0, mode->width, mode->height, mode->refreshRate);
.fi
.PP
.PP
Note that \fBglfwGetVideoMode\fP returns the \fIcurrent\fP video mode of a monitor, so if you already have a full screen window on that monitor that you want to make windowed full screen, you need to have saved the desktop resolution before\&.
.SS "Window destruction"
When a window is no longer needed, destroy it with \fBglfwDestroyWindow\fP\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
glfwDestroyWindow(window);
.fi
.PP
.PP
Window destruction always succeeds\&. Before the actual destruction, all callbacks are removed so no further events will be delivered for the window\&. All windows remaining when \fBglfwTerminate\fP is called are destroyed as well\&.
.PP
When a full screen window is destroyed, the original video mode of its monitor is restored, but the gamma ramp is left untouched\&.
.SS "Window creation hints"
There are a number of hints that can be set before the creation of a window and context\&. Some affect the window itself, others affect the framebuffer or context\&. These hints are set to their default values each time the library is initialized with \fBglfwInit\fP\&. Integer value hints can be set individually with \fBglfwWindowHint\fP and string value hints with \fBglfwWindowHintString\fP\&. You can reset all at once to their defaults with \fBglfwDefaultWindowHints\fP\&.
.PP
Some hints are platform specific\&. These are always valid to set on any platform but they will only affect their specific platform\&. Other platforms will ignore them\&. Setting these hints requires no platform specific headers or calls\&.
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
Window hints need to be set before the creation of the window and context you wish to have the specified attributes\&. They function as additional arguments to \fBglfwCreateWindow\fP\&.
.RE
.PP
.SS "Hard and soft constraints"
Some window hints are hard constraints\&. These must match the available capabilities \fIexactly\fP for window and context creation to succeed\&. Hints that are not hard constraints are matched as closely as possible, but the resulting context and framebuffer may differ from what these hints requested\&.
.PP
The following hints are always hard constraints:
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBGLFW_STEREO\fP

\fBGLFW_DOUBLEBUFFER\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBGLFW_CLIENT_API\fP

\fBGLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE\fP
.PP
.SS "Window related hints"
\fBGLFW_RESIZABLE\fP specifies whether the windowed mode window will be resizable \fIby the user\fP\&. The window will still be resizable using the \fBglfwSetWindowSize\fP function\&. Possible values are \fCGLFW_TRUE\fP and \fCGLFW_FALSE\fP\&. This hint is ignored for full screen and undecorated windows\&.
.PP
\fBGLFW_VISIBLE\fP specifies whether the windowed mode window will be initially visible\&. Possible values are \fCGLFW_TRUE\fP and \fCGLFW_FALSE\fP\&. This hint is ignored for full screen windows\&.
.PP
\fBGLFW_DECORATED\fP specifies whether the windowed mode window will have window decorations such as a border, a close widget, etc\&. An undecorated window will not be resizable by the user but will still allow the user to generate close events on some platforms\&. Possible values are \fCGLFW_TRUE\fP and \fCGLFW_FALSE\fP\&. This hint is ignored for full screen windows\&.
.PP
\fBGLFW_FOCUSED\fP specifies whether the windowed mode window will be given input focus when created\&. Possible values are \fCGLFW_TRUE\fP and \fCGLFW_FALSE\fP\&. This hint is ignored for full screen and initially hidden windows\&.
.PP
\fBGLFW_AUTO_ICONIFY\fP specifies whether the full screen window will automatically iconify and restore the previous video mode on input focus loss\&. Possible values are \fCGLFW_TRUE\fP and \fCGLFW_FALSE\fP\&. This hint is ignored for windowed mode windows\&.
.PP
\fBGLFW_FLOATING\fP specifies whether the windowed mode window will be floating above other regular windows, also called topmost or always-on-top\&. This is intended primarily for debugging purposes and cannot be used to implement proper full screen windows\&. Possible values are \fCGLFW_TRUE\fP and \fCGLFW_FALSE\fP\&. This hint is ignored for full screen windows\&.
.PP
\fBGLFW_MAXIMIZED\fP specifies whether the windowed mode window will be maximized when created\&. Possible values are \fCGLFW_TRUE\fP and \fCGLFW_FALSE\fP\&. This hint is ignored for full screen windows\&.
.PP
\fBGLFW_CENTER_CURSOR\fP specifies whether the cursor should be centered over newly created full screen windows\&. Possible values are \fCGLFW_TRUE\fP and \fCGLFW_FALSE\fP\&. This hint is ignored for windowed mode windows\&.
.PP
\fBGLFW_TRANSPARENT_FRAMEBUFFER\fP specifies whether the window framebuffer will be transparent\&. If enabled and supported by the system, the window framebuffer alpha channel will be used to combine the framebuffer with the background\&. This does not affect window decorations\&. Possible values are \fCGLFW_TRUE\fP and \fCGLFW_FALSE\fP\&.
.PP
\fBGLFW_FOCUS_ON_SHOW\fP specifies whether the window will be given input focus when \fBglfwShowWindow\fP is called\&. Possible values are \fCGLFW_TRUE\fP and \fCGLFW_FALSE\fP\&.
.PP
\fBGLFW_SCALE_TO_MONITOR\fP specified whether the window content area should be resized based on the \fBmonitor content scale\fP of any monitor it is placed on\&. This includes the initial placement when the window is created\&. Possible values are \fCGLFW_TRUE\fP and \fCGLFW_FALSE\fP\&.
.PP
This hint only has an effect on platforms where screen coordinates and pixels always map 1:1 such as Windows and X11\&. On platforms like macOS the resolution of the framebuffer is changed independently of the window size\&.
.SS "Framebuffer related hints"
\fBGLFW_RED_BITS\fP, \fBGLFW_GREEN_BITS\fP, \fBGLFW_BLUE_BITS\fP, \fBGLFW_ALPHA_BITS\fP, \fBGLFW_DEPTH_BITS\fP and \fBGLFW_STENCIL_BITS\fP specify the desired bit depths of the various components of the default framebuffer\&. A value of \fCGLFW_DONT_CARE\fP means the application has no preference\&.
.PP
\fBGLFW_ACCUM_RED_BITS\fP, \fBGLFW_ACCUM_GREEN_BITS\fP, \fBGLFW_ACCUM_BLUE_BITS\fP and \fBGLFW_ACCUM_ALPHA_BITS\fP specify the desired bit depths of the various components of the accumulation buffer\&. A value of \fCGLFW_DONT_CARE\fP means the application has no preference\&.
.PP
\fB\fP
.RS 4
Accumulation buffers are a legacy OpenGL feature and should not be used in new code\&.

\fBGLFW_STEREO\fP specifies whether to use OpenGL stereoscopic rendering\&. Possible values are \fCGLFW_TRUE\fP and \fCGLFW_FALSE\fP\&. This is a hard constraint\&.
.PP
\fBGLFW_SAMPLES\fP specifies the desired number of samples to use for multisampling\&. Zero disables multisampling\&. A value of \fCGLFW_DONT_CARE\fP means the application has no preference\&.

\fBGLFW_SRGB_CAPABLE\fP specifies whether the framebuffer should be sRGB capable\&. Possible values are \fCGLFW_TRUE\fP and \fCGLFW_FALSE\fP\&.
.PP
\fB\fP

\fBGLFW_DOUBLEBUFFER\fP specifies whether the framebuffer should be double buffered\&. You nearly always want to use double buffering\&. This is a hard constraint\&. Possible values are \fCGLFW_TRUE\fP and \fCGLFW_FALSE\fP\&.
.SS "Monitor related hints"
\fBGLFW_REFRESH_RATE\fP specifies the desired refresh rate for full screen windows\&. A value of \fCGLFW_DONT_CARE\fP means the highest available refresh rate will be used\&. This hint is ignored for windowed mode windows\&.
.SS "Context related hints"
\fBGLFW_CLIENT_API\fP specifies which client API to create the context for\&. Possible values are \fCGLFW_OPENGL_API\fP, \fCGLFW_OPENGL_ES_API\fP and \fCGLFW_NO_API\fP\&. This is a hard constraint\&.
.PP
\fBGLFW_CONTEXT_CREATION_API\fP specifies which context creation API to use to create the context\&. Possible values are \fCGLFW_NATIVE_CONTEXT_API\fP, \fCGLFW_EGL_CONTEXT_API\fP and \fCGLFW_OSMESA_CONTEXT_API\fP\&. This is a hard constraint\&. If no client API is requested, this hint is ignored\&.

\fBOpenGL:\fP These hints are not hard constraints, but creation will fail if the OpenGL version of the created context is less than the one requested\&. It is therefore perfectly safe to use the default of version 1\&.0 for legacy code and you will still get backwards-compatible contexts of version 3\&.0 and above when available\&.

\fBOpenGL ES:\fP These hints are not hard constraints, but creation will fail if the OpenGL ES version of the created context is less than the one requested\&. Additionally, OpenGL ES 1\&.x cannot be returned if 2\&.0 or later was requested, and vice versa\&. This is because OpenGL ES 3\&.x is backward compatible with 2\&.0, but OpenGL ES 2\&.0 is not backward compatible with 1\&.x\&.

@macos The OS only supports forward-compatible core profile contexts for OpenGL versions 3\&.2 and later\&.

OpenGL 3\&.0 and 3\&.1 contexts are not supported at all on macOS\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBGLFW_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT\fP specifies whether the OpenGL context should be forward-compatible, i\&.e\&. one where all functionality deprecated in the requested version of OpenGL is removed\&. This must only be used if the requested OpenGL version is 3\&.0 or above\&. If OpenGL ES is requested, this hint is ignored\&.

.SS "Window size"
The size of a window can be changed with \fBglfwSetWindowSize\fP\&. For windowed mode windows, this sets the size, in \fBscreen coordinates\fP of the \fIcontent area\fP or \fIcontent area\fP of the window\&. The window system may impose limits on window size\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
glfwSetWindowSize(window, 640, 480);
.fi
.PP
.PP
For full screen windows, the specified size becomes the new resolution of the window's desired video mode\&. The video mode most closely matching the new desired video mode is set immediately\&. The window is resized to fit the resolution of the set video mode\&.

If you wish to be notified when a window is resized, whether by the user, the system or your own code, set a size callback\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
glfwSetWindowSizeCallback(window, window_size_callback);

Do not pass the window size to \fCglViewport\fP or other pixel-based OpenGL calls\&. The window size is in screen coordinates, not pixels\&. Use the \fBframebuffer size\fP, which is in pixels, for pixel-based calls\&.
.RE

The above functions work with the size of the content area, but decorated windows typically have title bars and window frames around this rectangle\&. You can retrieve the extents of these with \fBglfwGetWindowFrameSize\fP\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
int left, top, right, bottom;
glfwGetWindowFrameSize(window, &left, &top, &right, &bottom);

.PP
.PP
The returned values are the distances, in screen coordinates, from the edges of the content area to the corresponding edges of the full window\&. As they are distances and not coordinates, they are always zero or positive\&.
.SS "Framebuffer size"
While the size of a window is measured in screen coordinates, OpenGL works with pixels\&. The size you pass into \fCglViewport\fP, for example, should be in pixels\&. On some machines screen coordinates and pixels are the same, but on others they will not be\&. There is a second set of functions to retrieve the size, in pixels, of the framebuffer of a window\&.
.PP
If you wish to be notified when the framebuffer of a window is resized, whether by the user or the system, set a size callback\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
glfwSetFramebufferSizeCallback(window, framebuffer_size_callback);

The content scale for a window can be retrieved with \fBglfwGetWindowContentScale\fP\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
float xscale, yscale;
glfwGetWindowContentScale(window, &xscale, &yscale);
.fi
.PP
.PP
The content scale is the ratio between the current DPI and the platform's default DPI\&. This is especially important for text and any UI elements\&. If the pixel dimensions of your UI scaled by this look appropriate on your machine then it should appear at a reasonable size on other machines regardless of their DPI and scaling settings\&. This relies on the system DPI and scaling settings being somewhat correct\&.
.PP
On systems where each monitors can have its own content scale, the window content scale will depend on which monitor the system considers the window to be on\&.
.PP
If you wish to be notified when the content scale of a window changes, whether because of a system setting change or because it was moved to a monitor with a different scale, set a content scale callback\&.
.PP
.PP

}
.fi
.PP
.PP
On platforms where pixels and screen coordinates always map 1:1, the window will need to be resized to appear the same size when it is moved to a monitor with a different content scale\&. To have this done automatically both when the window is created and when its content scale later changes, set the \fBGLFW_SCALE_TO_MONITOR\fP window hint\&.
.SS "Window size limits"
The minimum and maximum size of the content area of a windowed mode window can be enforced with \fBglfwSetWindowSizeLimits\fP\&. The user may resize the window to any size and aspect ratio within the specified limits, unless the aspect ratio is also set\&.

The aspect ratio of the content area of a windowed mode window can be enforced with \fBglfwSetWindowAspectRatio\fP\&. The user may resize the window freely unless size limits are also set, but the size will be constrained to maintain the aspect ratio\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
glfwSetWindowAspectRatio(window, 16, 9);

You can have both size limits and aspect ratio set for a window, but the results are undefined if they conflict\&.
.SS "Window position"
The position of a windowed-mode window can be changed with \fBglfwSetWindowPos\fP\&. This moves the window so that the upper-left corner of its content area has the specified \fBscreen coordinates\fP\&. The window system may put limitations on window placement\&.

.nf
GLFWmonitor* monitor = glfwGetWindowMonitor(window);
.fi
.PP

This monitor handle is one of those returned by \fBglfwGetMonitors\fP\&.
.PP
For windowed mode windows, this function returns \fCNULL\fP\&. This is how to tell full screen windows from windowed mode windows\&.
.PP
You can move windows between monitors or between full screen and windowed mode with \fBglfwSetWindowMonitor\fP\&. When making a window full screen on the same or on a different monitor, specify the desired monitor, resolution and refresh rate\&. The position arguments are ignored\&.

When calling \fCglGetFramebufferAttachmentParameteriv\fP, the red, green, blue and alpha sizes are queried from the \fCGL_BACK_LEFT\fP, while the depth and stencil sizes are queried from the \fCGL_DEPTH\fP and \fCGL_STENCIL\fP attachments, respectively\&.
.SH "Buffer swapping"
.PP
GLFW windows are by default double buffered\&. That means that you have two rendering buffers; a front buffer and a back buffer\&. The front buffer is the one being displayed and the back buffer the one you render to\&.
.PP
When the entire frame has been rendered, it is time to swap the back and the front buffers in order to display what has been rendered and begin rendering a new frame\&. This is done with \fBglfwSwapBuffers\fP\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
glfwSwapBuffers(window);
.fi
.PP
.PP
Sometimes it can be useful to select when the buffer swap will occur\&. With the function \fBglfwSwapInterval\fP it is possible to select the minimum number of monitor refreshes the driver wait should from the time \fBglfwSwapBuffers\fP was called before swapping the buffers:
.PP
.PP
.nf
glfwSwapInterval(1);
.fi
.PP
.PP
If the interval is zero, the swap will take place immediately when \fBglfwSwapBuffers\fP is called without waiting for a refresh\&. Otherwise at least interval retraces will pass between each buffer swap\&. Using a swap interval of zero can be useful for benchmarking purposes, when it is not desirable to measure the time it takes to wait for the vertical retrace\&. However, a swap interval of one lets you avoid tearing\&.
.PP
Note that this may not work on all machines, as some drivers have user-controlled settings that override any swap interval the application requests\&.
.PP
A context that supports either the \fCWGL_EXT_swap_control_tear\fP or the \fCGLX_EXT_swap_control_tear\fP extension also accepts \fInegative\fP swap intervals, which allows the driver to swap immediately even if a frame arrives a little bit late\&. This trades the risk of visible tears for greater framerate stability\&. You can check for these extensions with \fBglfwExtensionSupported\fP\&.
